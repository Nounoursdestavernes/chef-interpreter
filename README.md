# chef-interpreter

[Chef](https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/chef.html) is an esoteric programming language developed by [David Morgan-Mar](https://www.dangermouse.net/). In Chef, programs are written to resemble real recipes as closely as possible.

`chef-interpreter` is a work in progress. Written in Go, it interprets recipes written in Chef and prints their results. Currently, it's only partially completedâ€”stay tuned!

A single Chef recipe is provided along with the interpreter for testing: Caleb's Butterless Pi Crust. Based on a pie crust recipe from a friend, this recipe calculates pi with six digits of precision.

(For another Chef recipe, I highly recommend Mike Worth's [Hello World Cake with Chocolate Sauce](http://www.mike-worth.com/2013/03/31/baking-a-hello-world-cake/). This is my favorite recipe in Chef! Not only does it print "Hello World," it also works as a real cake recipe.)
